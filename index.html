        <p>
            Blossom is a functional programming language that 
            features strong static types, first class support
            for message passing, high level abstractions and
            immutable data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Blossom, like this website, is still a work in progress.
            We the authors reserve the right to make any changes we see
            fit to the language specification at this time. However we'd love
            for you to start using the language and to give us feedback on
            how we can improve it. A somewhat functional Blossom interpretor
            can be found in our <a href='http://github.com/NaOHman/Blossom'>
            our git repo</a>.
